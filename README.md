# Database Project for Azure SQL Database

Example of a SQL Server Database Project that deploys to an Azure SQL Database in Azure DevOps. Which I introduced in a blog post called 'T-SQL Tuesday 142 - Introducing my Azure DevOps templates for Data Platform deployments' (https://bit.ly/33k3N5r).

It uses a YAML pipeline, which is in the AzureDevOpsTemplates folder.

In order to use it in Azure Pipelines you can either import or fork this repository into another GitHub repository or into Azure Repos.

Afterwards, you can select the YAML file in Azure Pipelines and tailor the pipeline to suit your needs.
